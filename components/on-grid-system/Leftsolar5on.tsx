          <span className="text-orange-500 md:text-lg text-sm mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Did you know that most houses in India install on-grid solar systems
            for homes? However, when there’s no grid nearby (in rural areas or
            for agricultural purposes), a stand alone solar system i.e. off grid
            solar system is the best option.

          Cost of an off grid solar power system
        </h2>
        <p className="text-orange-500 md:text-lg text-sm mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          When we talk about the off grid solar system price, we’re talking
          about everything ranging from procurement to installation and
          after-installation services.
          <br />
          <br />
          Including everything, the off grid solar system price comes between
          ₹85-100/ watt peak including batteries. This price variation is
          because the end cost depends on the battery backup.
          <br />
          <br />
          For instance, if somebody requires a backup for 30 minutes to an hour,
          smaller batteries will be able to cater to that need. On the other
          hand, if somebody requires a backup of 6-7 hours, the battery size
          increases; so will the cost.
          <br />
          <br />
          Putting it out simply, the higher the battery’s capacity, the more
          will the off grid solar system price.

          ROI on an off grid system
        </h2>
        <p className="text-orange-500 md:text-lg text-sm mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          ROI (return on investment) in the case of off grid solar takes more
          time than an on-grid system of the same capacity. Why? Well, because
          batteries are expensive. Usually, the off grid solar system price
          breaks even in about 6-7 years.
          <br />
          <br />
          This is actually one of the limitations of an off grid solar system.
          Batteries are yet not that scalable due to their high cost. That’s why
          it takes time for the cost to break even.

                The cost of fossil-fuel-based electricity from the grid is super

                economical than having to pay for grid electricity.

          A solar power off grid system aka a stand alone solar system is the

          Undoubtedly, the off grid solar system price breaks even in about 6-7
          years, but when you look at it in a way that grid electricity from
          fossil fuels is extremely expensive, the cost of an off grid solar
          system for home will automatically be justified.

          </h2>
          <p className="text-orange-500 md:text-lg text-sm mb-2 leading-relaxed">
            An off grid solar system is also known as a stand alone solar
            system. It works independently from the grid.
            <br />
            <br />
            Solar panels turn sunlight into electricity and a charge controller
            distributes that electricity to run household appliances during the
            sunshine hours and simultaneously charges the batteries when there’s
            extra power.
            <br />
            <br />
            The stored energy in the batteries is then used to keep the house
            running at night.
