      </h2>
      <p className="text-orange-500 md:text-lg text-sm mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        SolarSquare is born out of the passion to de-escalate pollution and
        escalate the adoption of mass solar. Two like-minded environment pros
        from IIT Bombay started SolarSquare in 2015 as a two-member pack. Now,
        we’re the 3rd largest EPC contractor for residential installations in
        India. We’ve helped 25,000+ homes go solar and have been helping our
        customers save up to 90% on their monthly electricity bills. We install
        both on-grid and hybrid solar systems. In the near future, we will start
        the installation of off-grid solar systems too. Some of the services
        that have set us apart from other vendors include the following.
